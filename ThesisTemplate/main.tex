\section*{Abstract}
In this paper a feasibility study of a Content-Based Job Recommender System (JRS) for welfare beneficiaries is described.
It is found that the Neural Network is the best model for learning to predict a job match. 
However, this model does not translate into a good top-n rank recommender. 
Methods for dealing with label sparsity and practical approaches to improve the performance proved to be ineffective. 
The research highlights the importance of a good quantity and quality of the data for the success of a JRS. 
Given the used data currently a JRS is not feasible, however if measures are taken to improve the data it can be in the future.

\section*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank the municipality of Amsterdam for offering me the opportunity to do this research project. 
The municipality give me the trust and freedom to carry out this project, it was a pleasure to work in such a friendly and encouraging environment.
I would to thank Camiel de Wit, Erik-Jan Hombergen and Jovita Bos for providing whatever data I needed, and for always willing to help and answer my questions. 
Also I would like to thank Toetske Renier for getting me on board in the project team and helping me to break down any barriers. 
I would like to specially thank Lonneke van Oirschot for her guidance as my supervisor within the municipality of Amsterdam, without her effort and expertise this project would not have been possible. 
Last but not least I would like to thank Harrie Oosterhuis for his role as my supervisor. 
His friendliness and expert knowledge really contributed for completing this thesis project.
