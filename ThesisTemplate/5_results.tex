\todo{Clustering}
%K-modes - descent, but no better learning results when predicting cluster or when added as extra feature
%hierarchical - good results on visual inspection, but no better learning results when predicting cluster or when added as extra feature (check this!)

\todo{Content based Models}
% Neural network
    % One layer setup works best (assumption of overfitting when more layers are added)
% Logistic Regression
    % Ranking: same rankings for every user, because per row the user is the same and only the jobs are different
% Ranking
    % Random outcomes
    % validated by overfitting on subsample, predicted all 1

\todo{Strategies to improve}
% Under-oversampling worsen results
% Feature importance slight improvement of results
