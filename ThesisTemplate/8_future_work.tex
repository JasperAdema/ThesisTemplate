% Better registration 
% - of job matching out comes 
% - reduce bias introduced by the customer managers (standardized tests) 
% - sample should represent the whole population (not only the best candidates) 
% - less user features, determine the most important ones

%create user and or job groups (promote the same hiring criteria for the same jobs)

% redo research!
% - what should be the minimum sample size? for attempting this?
% - research one: most important user features (social research)
% - research two: research jrs (project for multiple ds researchers)
% - research three: validate the jrs in reallife setting (A/B-testing, user study) (social and ds study)

% other RS techniques, CF becomes a possibility when the registration is better
% Maybe multiple recommenders, each for a specific group, if the groups really have specific demands (other features like limitations should be takeninto account)
%Sliding window, constantly retrain the jrs to take labor market dynamics into account.
